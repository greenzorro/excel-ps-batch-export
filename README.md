Python script for reading a PSD template and applying contents in a spreadsheet to export plenty of images. It's an alternative to Photoshop Image > Variables > Define.

ðŸ“º Example - Create spreadsheet

ðŸ“º Example - Manual export

ðŸ“º Example - Auto export

This is what you do using Photoshop:

1. Edit content in a spreadsheet.
2. Save spreadsheet as a CSV file.
3. Define variables for layers in Photoshop.
4. Import the CSV file.
5. Export data sets as files. Unfortunately, you get .psd files.
6. Make a automate-batch to save PSD as JPG or PNG.
7. Use the automate-batch to get final images.

Here's what you do using my Python script.

1. Edit content in a spreadsheet.
2. Run batch_export.py

That's it. Images will be just there for you. All you need is a Python environment with a few packages.

## Download

Two ways of downloading:

1. `git clone https://github.com/greenzorro/excel-ps-batch-export.git`
2. click the button Code, then Download ZIP

## Setup

For the first time, you'll need some basic setup:

1. Place your PSD template files here.
2. Edit PSD template file. Rename all changeable layers or groups with this pattern:
    - Format: `@Variable_name#Operation_Parameter`
    - A layer name may be like: `@badge#v`, `@description#t_p` or `@bg#i`
    - `@` tells the script that this layer is changeable, go and get content from the spreadsheet
    - `Variable_name` should appear in the spreadsheet as column head
    - `#Operation_Parameter` tells the script what to do with the layer
    - `#v` to set visibility according to TRUE/FALSE in the spreadsheet
    - `#t` to replace a text layer content with spreadsheet data, parameters including:
        - Text align left top by default
        - `_c` for horizontally center alignment
        - `_r` for horizontally right alignment
        - `_p` for paragraph with text wraping, fill the paragraph text layer in PSD with at least one line
        - `_pm` for vertically middle alignment
        - `_pb` for vertically bottom alignment
        - All these parameters work together, like `#t_c_p`, `#t_r_pb`
        - Alignment set in PSD will not affect the result, the program only checks layer names
    - `#i` to fill a pixel layer with the image whose file path is written in the spreadsheet
    - One thing to note: Do not use cmd/ctrl+T to scale changeable text layers. Adjust their sizes only via font size attribute, otherwise the script will get wrong text sizes from the PSD file. If you already did, make new text layers to replace them.
3. Run `create_xlsx.py`. Your XLSX files will appear, with columns ready.
4. Edit XLSX file. Python reads the first sheet, put your data there. Or you may follow the example, put your data in another sheet and use Excel formulas in the first one to read and calculate everything. It's especially useful when you want to toggle layer visibility. DO NOT delete the first `File_name` column, leave it blank to use the default file name format(image_1, image_2, etc).
5. Put everything else the templates need in `assets` folder, including fonts, background images, etc. Make sure the path to image assets match the data in the spreadsheet.

Looks complicated huh? Trust me, it's way more complicated doing the same thing using Photoshop. And once you've done setting up, this would be your life saver.

## Export

When it comes to exporting. Things become a piece of cake:

1. Paste content in the spreadsheet.
2. Run batch_export.py

I even made another script to moniter the spreadsheet and export images automatically once the spreadsheets are modified.

## Prerequisite

```
pip install pillow pandas openpyxl psd-tools
```

## Thanks

Special thanks to [psd-tools](https://github.com/psd-tools/psd-tools) for providing such powerful APIs to interact with PSD files. Therefore I could ultilize the power of Photoshop at image editing and Excel/Python at data processing.
